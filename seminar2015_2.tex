% SKEP I didn't have any surveys in the Philippines and only began in 2009, how do you have these data included?

% This is unclear? "Network analysis revealed interactions among insect pests and diseases, and strongly indicated the occurrence of their relations." what relations?

% What other pests? "In wet season, incidence of bacterial leaf streak, damage by whorl maggots, incidence of silver shoot and the number of brown plant hoppers showed strong co-occurrence with other pests"

Pests are the blocks in the big wall of yield losses that agronomists have to deal with because of the need to increase crop productivity. Survey data from farmers' fields are useful sources of data to help us to determine the importance of pests and understand the complex interactions of the agroecosystem. Spearman's rank correlation-based network analysis was used to identify the co-occurrence correlations of the incidence of insect pests and diseases from survey data collected in 450 farmers' fields in irrigated lowland rice growing areas in five countries India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam from 2007 to 2010. Network analysis revealed interactions among insect pests and diseases, and strongly indicated the occurrence of their relations. In wet season, incidence of bacterial leaf streak, damage by whorl maggots, incidence of silver shoot and the number of brown plant hoppers showed strong co-occurrence with other pests. While the incidence of narrow brown spot, number of brown plant hoppers, and white backed plant hoppers showed strong co-occurrence in dry season. The strong co-occurrence of selected pests potentially indicate the key pests to control.
